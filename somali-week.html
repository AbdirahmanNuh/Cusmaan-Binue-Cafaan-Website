        <p>Last week, our school was alive with the spirit of culture and tradition as we celebrated Somali Language Week. The week was filled with poetry, traditional stories, and special events designed to honor and promote our rich linguistic and cultural heritage.</p>
        <p>The goal of the week was to inspire students to take pride in their mother tongue and to deepen their connection with the stories and wisdom passed down through generations. From classroom activities to school-wide assemblies, every event was a celebration of what makes our culture unique.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Poetry Recitations:</strong> Students from all forms shared powerful performances of both classic and original Somali poetry.</li>
