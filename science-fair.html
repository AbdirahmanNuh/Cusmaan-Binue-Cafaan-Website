      <h1>Annual Science Fair Showcases Student Innovation</h1>
      
      <div class="article-body">
        <p>Our campus was buzzing with excitement during the Annual Science Fair, where students from all forms presented remarkable projects spanning biology, chemistry, physics, and robotics. The event highlighted the incredible curiosity and dedication of our students, who have spent weeks researching, building, and refining their work.</p>
        <p>Parents, teachers, and a panel of esteemed judges from the local university were impressed by the high standard of the projects. From a functional water purification system to a detailed study of local plant life, the exhibits demonstrated a deep understanding of scientific principles and a creative approach to problem-solving.</p>
        <h2>Highlights from the Event</h2>
        <p>The top prize was awarded to a team of Form 3 students for their innovative automated irrigation system designed to conserve water—a project that combines both engineering and environmental science. Other notable entries included a detailed model of the human circulatory system and a fascinating experiment on renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>We extend our heartfelt congratulations to all participants for their hard work and inspiring projects. This event is a true testament to our school's commitment to fostering a love for science and inquiry.</p>
