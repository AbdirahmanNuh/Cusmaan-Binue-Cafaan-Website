      <h1>Students Lead Successful Community Clean-up Drive</h1>
      
      <div class="article-body">
        <p>Embodying our school's core value of service, over 50 student volunteers from all forms participated in a highly successful community clean-up day this past weekend. The event was organized by the Student Council in partnership with local community leaders to help beautify and maintain public spaces near our campus.</p>
        <p>Armed with gloves, bags, and a tremendous amount of enthusiasm, our students worked for several hours, demonstrating a powerful commitment to civic responsibility. Their efforts were praised by local residents and officials who stopped by to offer their thanks.</p>
        <h2>A Day of Impact</h2>
        <p>The drive focused on the main park and surrounding streets, resulting in a cleaner and safer environment for everyone. Key achievements from the day include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Over 20 large bags of litter and recyclables were collected and properly disposed of.</li>
            <li>Garden beds in the local park were weeded and prepared for new seasonal flowers.</li>
            <li>Several public benches were washed and cleaned.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are incredibly proud of our students for taking initiative and making a tangible, positive impact on their community. This event is a wonderful example of how our values extend beyond the classroom walls.</p>
